# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to customers who discontinue their services with a company. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for telecom businesses as it enables them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

**Project Goals**

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Thoroughly investigate the customer dataset to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing churn.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Create relevant features that capture customer behavior and demographics to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Building:** Develop predictive models to classify customers as likely or unlikely to churn.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
5. **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on model results to reduce churn rates.

**Dataset**

The project uses the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset. This dataset includes information on customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status (whether the customer churned or not).

**Key Features**

* **Customer Demographics:** Gender, age, marital status, dependents.
* **Service Usage:** Phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, streaming movies.
* **Contract Details:** Contract type (month-to-month, one year, two year), payment method, paperless billing.
* **Charges:** Monthly charges, total charges.
* **Churn Label:** Whether the customer churned or not.

**Methodology**



1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
   * Identify potential correlations with numerical features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Handle missing values.
   * Encoding categorical variables.
   * Scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Experiment with various classification models (e.g., logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting).
   * Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   * Employ cross-validation to assess model robustness.

**Code and Structure**

The project code is organized into the following files/directories:

* `data/`: Contains the original dataset (`Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`) and any processed datasets.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, analysis, model building, and evaluation.
* `models/`: Saved trained models (optional).
* `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and feature engineering (if applicable).
* `README.md`: This file.
* `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries needed to run the code.


**How to Run**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required libraries (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory.

**Additional Notes**

* This project is intended for educational and exploratory purposes.
* The models developed here may not be directly applicable to real-world scenarios without further customization and validation.
