# Telecom_Customer_Churn_Prediction

**Overview**

This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a telecommunications company. Customer churn, also known as customer attrition, refers to customers who discontinue their services with a company. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for telecom businesses as it enables them to take proactive measures to retain valuable customers. In this particular project I tried to recommend a discount of up to 20%, depending to how likely a customer will leave.

**Project Goals**

1. **Data Exploration and Analysis:** Thoroughly investigate the customer dataset to identify patterns, trends, and potential factors influencing churn.
2. **Model Building:** Develop predictive models to classify customers as likely or unlikely to churn.
3. **Model Evaluation:** Assess model performance using appropriate metrics and validation techniques.
4. **Insights and Recommendations:** Provide actionable insights and recommendations based on model results to reduce churn rates.

**Dataset**

The project uses the "Telco Customer Churn" dataset. This dataset includes information on customer demographics, service usage, contract details, and churn status (whether the customer churned or not).

**Key Features**

* **Customer Demographics:** Gender, age, marital status, dependents.
* **Service Usage:** Phone service, multiple lines, internet service, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, streaming TV, streaming movies.
* **Contract Details:** Contract type (month-to-month, one year, two year), payment method, paperless billing.
* **Charges:** Monthly charges, total charges.
* **Churn Label:** Whether the customer churned or not.

**Methodology**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   * Visualize distributions and relationships between features.
   * Identify potential correlations with numerical features.
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   * Handle missing values.
   * Encoding categorical variables.
   * Scaling numerical features.
3. **Model Selection and Training:**
   * Experiment with various classification models (e.g., Logistic regression, Random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, Support Vector Machine, Neural network).
   * Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
4. **Model Evaluation:**
   * Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
   * Employ cross-validation to assess model robustness.


**Additional Notes**

* This project is intended for educational and exploratory purposes.
* The models developed here may not be directly applicable to real-world scenarios without further customization and validation.
